### What is data Structure?
 - Simply, A named location that can be used to store and organize data.
 - Example; 
    - Consider a list of fruits
    - The list fruits is used to store and organize data

### What is Algorithms? 

- An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.
- Example;
  - A navigation system, such as Google Maps, uses algorithms to find the shortest or fastest route from one location to another
